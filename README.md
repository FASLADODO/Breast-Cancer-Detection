Undergraduate Thesis Project- Dimensionality Reduction Based Method for the Detection of Breast Cancer


This repository contains codes that I wrote for Bachelor Thesis Project. Breast cancer is one of those diseases which demands for ultimate diagnosis with higher degree of accuracy because it is the second leading cause of deaths in women worldwide and one out of eight women are affected by this disease. In this research work, the main objective is to develop and compare the integrated approaches involving dimensionality reduction, feature ranking, fuzzy logic and neural networks for the diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of breast cancer namely, benign and malignant. The database used in developing the above discussed model is adopted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, known as Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The structure of the repository-
